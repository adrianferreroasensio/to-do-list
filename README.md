# To-Do List

## Description

# To-Do List

This project consists of a to-do list application created to gain familiarity with JavaScript classes and modules. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using Webpack for bundling. Users can create new projects and add tasks with a description, due dates, and priority levels.

## Motivation

The To-Do List project is part of my self-learning journey through The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript course. The objective of this project was to practice using Webpack, JavaScript classes, and modules.
